## Notes

Question 10

Phrasing isn't "If you got an extra life, then you collected 100 coins";
the cause would be "You got an extra life" and the result would be
"you got 100 coins". It isn't a simple rephrasing of the original problem.

Example

* Original: "If you collect a green mushroom, then you get an extra life."
* Contrapositive: "If you don't collect an extra life, then you don't collect a green mushroom."
* Incorrect: "If you don't get an extra life, then you *didn't* collect the green mushroom."

Predicates

Too many people tried to write statements like "x is divisible by 3" symbolically. **These are supposed to be written out in English**, such as:

	P(x) is the predicate x is divisible by 3
	
We **never covered how to write a number as divisible by 3, or even, or odd** - that is in Chapter 2. Using English to define the predicates is fine.

For reference, the definition of an even number *n* is:

	n = 2k

and an odd number *m* is:

	m = 2a + 1

and a number *o* that is divisible by 4:

	o = 4b
