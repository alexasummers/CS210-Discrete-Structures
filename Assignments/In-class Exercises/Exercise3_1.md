**Team:**

Section:

Names:

1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 

**Rules:** 

* Work through these exercises with a team. 
* Only one answer sheet will be turned in, each team member will receive the same score. 
* Write cleanly and linearly. If I can't read it, I can't grade it.
* Turn in your answers on a separate answer sheet.

**Grading:** Each question has a weight, and can receive a score between 0 and 4

<table>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nothing written</td>
<td>Something attempted, but incorrect</td>
<td>Partially correct, but multiple errors</td>
<td>Mostly correct, with one or two errors</td>
<td>Perfect, correct answer and notation.</td>

## Section 1: Common sets of numbers

<blockquote>
The following sets you may have seen previously in other math classes.
We will also be working with them now in this class.  

<blockquote>
</blockquote>

**ℚ   The set of rational numbers**

These can be fractional, and are characterized as ratios of integers.
Examples: ℚ includes 1/2, -17/4, 3/1.

<blockquote>
</blockquote>

**ℕ   The set of natural numbers**

These are "counting numbers"; i.e., non-negative integers.
Examples: ℕ = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... }

<blockquote>
</blockquote>

**ℤ   The set of integers**

Whole numbers (positive, negative, and zero). No fractions or decimals.
(Though if a fraction reduces to an integer with a 1 on the bottom: 4/2, 5/1, etc.)
Examples: ℤ = { ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ... }

<blockquote>
</blockquote>

**ℝ   The set of real numbers**

Numbers that are not imaginary. This can include decimal numbers with 
possibly unending strings of digits after the decimal point.

</blockquote>

### Question 1 ()

**Match the numbers to sets:** For the following numbers, which set(s) do they belong to?

<table>
    <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>ℚ</th>
        <th>ℕ</th>
        <th>ℤ</th>
        <th>ℝ</th>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>  </td>
        <td>  </td>
        <td>  </td>
        <td>  </td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
        <td>-5</td>
        <td>  </td>
        <td>  </td>
        <td>  </td>
        <td>  </td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
        <td>8/4</td>
        <td>  </td>
        <td>  </td>
        <td>  </td>
        <td>  </td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
        <td>2.40</td>
        <td>  </td>
        <td>  </td>
        <td>  </td>
        <td>  </td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
        <td>π</td>
        <td>  </td>
        <td>  </td>
        <td>  </td>
        <td>  </td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Question 2 ()

**2a.** List three numbers that belong to the set ℤ, but not in the set ℕ.

**2b.** List three numbers that belong to the set ℚ, but not in the set ℤ.

**2c.** List three numbers that are in the set ℝ, but not in the set ℚ.

## Section 2: Subsets

<blockquote>

Next we will be defining our own sets, in order to define
the problem 'domain' for our problems.

When we are creating sets A, B, C, etc., there will also
be a universal set U, which contains all elements that
belong to all other sets.

Once we have our sets defined, we can do the following
operations on them:

<blockquote>
</blockquote>

**[A ∩ B:	The intersection of A and B]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory)))**
The intersection is a set that contains the elements
that are common to both A and B, and none of the
elements that show up in one but not the other.

In set-builder notation: A ∩ B = { x ∈ U : x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ B }

<blockquote>
</blockquote>

**[A ∪ B:	The union of A and B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory))**
The union is a set that contains all elements
from both A and B, merging their elements together.

In set-builder notation: A ∪ B = { x ∈ U : x ∈ A ∨ x ∈ B }

<blockquote>
</blockquote>

A - B:	The difference of A and B
The difference of A and B is the set of elements
in A, which are not also in B.

In set-builder notation: A - B = { x ∈ U : x ∈ A ∧ x ∉ B }

<blockquote>
</blockquote>

A':		The complement of A
Given some set A within the universe U, the
complement of A (A') is the set that contains
the elements in U, and none of the elements from A.
In other words, A' = U - A.

<blockquote>
</blockquote>

U:	The universal set is the set of all elements.

<blockquote>
</blockquote>

Ø:	The empty set is a set with no elements.

<blockquote>
</blockquote>

Disjoint sets:	A and B are disjoint sets if 
A ∩ B = Ø
