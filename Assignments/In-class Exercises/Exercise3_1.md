## Section 1: Common sets of numbers

    The following sets you may have seen previously in other math classes. We will also be working with them now in this colass,  
    ℚ   The set of rational numbers   These can be fractional, and are characterized as ratios of integers.
    ℕ   The set of natural numbers    These are "counting numbers"; i.e., non-negative integers.
    ℝ   The set of real numbers       Numbers that are not imaginary. This can include decimal numbers with possibly unending strings of digits after the decimal point.
    ℤ   The set of integers           Whole numbers (positive, negative, and zero). No fractions or decimals.
