## Section 1: Review predicates

<blockquote>

A **Predicate** is a function *P(x)* that results in either a
*true* or *false* value when some input *x* is given.

**Example:**

*P(x)* is the predicate, *"x is greater than 10"*.

Whether the output of *P(x)* is true or false depends
on the input *x*. *P(2)* is false, but *P(11)* is true.
 
</blockquote>

### Exercise 1

For the given predicates, write the results for each of the inputs specified.
The solution should be either *true* or *false*.

a. *P(n)* is *"n is an even integer."*

1. *P(1) =*
1. *P(2) =*
1. *P(3) =*
1. *P(2m) =*
1. *P(2m+1) =*

b. *P(n)* is *"n<sup>2</sup> + 1 is prime."*

1. *P(1) =*
1. *P(2) =*
1. *P(3) =*
1. *P(m-1) =*
