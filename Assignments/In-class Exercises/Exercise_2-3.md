CS 210, Spring 2017

**Rules:** 

* In-class exercises are given each class period for every chapter.
* Work with your groupmate(s) on this exercise.
* You will keep your own work. Make sure your attendance is counted so you get credit for this assignment.
* We will share our work at the end of class

## Section 1: Review predicates

<blockquote>

A **Predicate** is a function *P(x)* that results in either a
*true* or *false* value when some input *x* is given.

**Example:**

*P(x)* is the predicate, *"x is greater than 10"*.

Whether the output of *P(x)* is true or false depends
on the input *x*. *P(2)* is false, but *P(11)* is true.
 
</blockquote>

### Exercise 1

For the given predicates, write the results for each of the inputs specified.
The solution should be either *true* or *false*.

a. *P(n)* is *"n is an even integer."*

1. *P(1) =*
1. *P(2) =*
1. *P(3) =*
1. *P(2m) =*
1. *P(2m+1) =*

b. *P(n)* is *"n<sup>2</sup> + 1 is prime."*

1. *P(1) =*
1. *P(2) =*
1. *P(3) =*
1. *P(m-1) =*

## Section 2: Providing equivalence between a Recursive formula and a Closed formula

<blockquote>
Now we're getting into our heavier proofs. 
Chapters 2.3 and 2.4 have the main proofs that we are working on for this chapter. 
Once you learn the steps, they're not hard, 
but it can be difficult to keep them all straight. 
Make sure to get plenty of practice. 

The best way to illustrate how to prove a 
**recursive-closed formula equivalence**
is probably just to show an example with the steps highlighted. 

**Example:**

Show that the sequence defined by the recursive formula

*a<sub>k</sub> = a<sub>k-1</sub> + 4*, where *a<sub>1</sub> = 1*, for *k â‰¥ 2</sub>

is equivalently described by the closed formula *a<sub>n</sub> = 4n - 3*.
